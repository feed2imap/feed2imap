<div>Is it my imagination or is nautilus, with every release, getting closer to the interface of <a href="http://www.gnustep.it/enrico/gworkspace/">GWorkspace</a> ?<blockquote>

<br />Everything is there : the "places" (vertical in nautilus and horizontal in GWorkspace), the path bar (thankfully scaled down, but the idea is the same), the icon/list views... Of course, I guess inspiration mostly comes from the MacOS X rework of GWorkspace, but it's weird to think that this UI has been there for years, just waiting for somebody to pimp it up.<br />Now there is just the <a href="http://actsofvolition.com/images/screenshots/next-column-view.png">column view</a> left to implement, and we'll be at 1:1 features ratio (although with good drag-n-drop management the current path bar could replace that view in most of the cases).</div>
